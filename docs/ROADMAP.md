# Feature Roadmap

## My JSON Resume v0.0.1!
This is a list of all the initial features I'll be working to include in my first release!
[] Documentation - readme, getting started, contributors, contributing, repo outline, etc.
[] Dev branch contributing procedures for new features and issues
[] Resume assets automatically generated on change to resume.json files! 
[] Profiles feature for non-root folder resumes! Make as many as you want!
[] A way for users to edit the original macciato theme this project was built on.

## Dev Framework

There should be a way to test changes to the resume before pushing it to main.
This could be really simple, something like creating a branch and makefile functions
to view a new rendering of our resume and then creating a PR request for changes 
to resume.json

## Create a blog site hosted on aceamarco.dev, with this resume on one of the tabs

The end goal for me has always been to add my resume to personal blog page. I'd like to figure out how
to use this repo containing my current resume + profiles to make creating a new resume easier.
